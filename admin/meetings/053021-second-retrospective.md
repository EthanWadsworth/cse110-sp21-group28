## AGENDA:
### Meeting Schedule today:
1. Agile - Retrospective (Needs markdown file in github)
2. Questions

### Agile Retrospective:
- Read through agile retrospective individually again then discussed the assignment as a team.
- We talked as a group about our sprint meeting and were trying understand what was done better from the previous meeting and what we should have done better
- We gathered all of our thoughts on Miro and explained everything thoroughly to each other
- This time around, we were more efficient when we explained and even demoed everything we have done since we last met
- In addition, we all communicated well with our teammates and knew who was going to speak about which parts of our respective tasks
- Group members have been clear about what they need and if they need any help
- What we could have done better was worked more on the project in the last week (all busy because of other work from other classes/life)
- In the future, we should definitely start to communicate between teams early on to make sure that everyone is on the same page
- The results of this Miro diagram are located in the markdown file on github with an image of what we worked on and a brief explanation of the miro diagram.

### To Do
- Connect components together
- Use github issues to know what everyone is doing at what time
- Move members over to make sure that we can complete the project

### End of Meeting
We decided to meet again tomorrow around 3 PM to split up tasks and be more productive as a team
- Frank needs to input our agile retrospective in a markdown file
- I need to finish the retrospective and agile sprint review meeting notes
- We decided to continue working on our parts of the bullet journal and meet each other accordingly.     
End Meeting: 7:00 PM
