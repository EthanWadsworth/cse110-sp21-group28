## Objective for Today
Today, our goal was to go over each assignment that is due this week. More specifically, we went did another ADR, finished the team status video, and talked about the CI/CD Pipeline in regards to what we want to complete before tomorrow's checkpoint.

## AGENDA:
### Meeting Schedule today:
1. Agile - Retrospective (Needs markdown file in github)
2. ADR Decision (Needs markdown file in github)
3. CI/CD Pipeline (Needs checkpoint in repo)
4. Team Status Update Video

### Agile Retrospective:
- Read through agile retrospective individually then discussed the assignment as a team.
- We talked as a group about our sprint meeting and were trying to critique what was said, how we said it, whether it was supported by code or not.
- We gathered all of our thoughts on Miro and explained everything thoroughly to each other
- We want to enhance interteam cooperation for the future especially because all of our teams will end up working with each other.
- The results of this Miro diagram are located in the markdown file on github with an image of what we worked on and a brief explanation of the miro diagram.


### 2nd ADR decision
- We decided to change our database from MongoDB to Firebase. This is because it was easier to set up via firebase and it was easier to implement
- MongoDB doesnt have easy authentication so it is more manual. More involved and will take much more time.
- For more information, look to the ADR markdown file which is on this github repo.

### CI/CD Pipeline
Use github actions to check each process and each file for node. Make modifications of original github material.
- Ethan W. is going to look more into this process
- Already included stuff about our planned CI/CD pipeline

### Agile Team Status Video
- Read about the agile team status video and go through it as a team
- Plan what we want to say as teams (breakout rooms)
- We came togeither as a group and presented what we had in the meeting itself (Ethan T. recorded each part)
- Lastly, we designated (Allen Cheung) to splice the recordings of the messages together.

### End of Meeting
We decided to attend tomorrow's discussion section with our TA to ask questions.
- In regards to what we need to do, Allen is tasked with splicing today's recording to submit the team status video.
- Edward needs to submit the ADR to github
- Jacob needs to input our agile retrospective in a markdown file
- We decided to continue working on our parts of the bullet journal and meet each other accordingly.     
End Meeting: 7:50 PM
