## Agile Sprint Review 6 Meeting Notes

### Fixing Small Bugs
- Last sprint meeting we encountered some bugs after adding in more unit tests
- We removed the unit tests that were causing the issue and found a solution between meetings
- This meeting, we reimplemented the unit tests as well as the solution 

### Recording and Editing Videos
- We created a script a while back for our videos - today was the day we recorded
- While others were working on fixing small bugs and finishing up unit testing, others refined their script and recorded

###### TO DO
- Have video play tomorrow!

Finish Time: 6/10:  3 PM
