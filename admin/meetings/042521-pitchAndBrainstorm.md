## Meeting Notes
- Wait for a couple of minutes to ensure that everyone joins before we get started with the meeting.
- Ethan and Frank explained that today, we will go through our Brainstorm thoughts again and also use that to come up with some ideas for a project pitch.
- Brief complaining about other classes by numerous members (aka brief group bonding session) :)

### Brainstorm
- We went over our Brainstorm again in detail.
- After talking to each other about what we want for the project and about what the Brainstorm should mean for the rest of the quarter, we realized that everything we needed and all of the important points were already touched upon. 
- We concluded that our Brainstorm was very specific towards what we want which we believed was a great indication that we were well on our way to succeed in our project.
- We did not add anything but rather we reviewed what we had and proceeded towards the project pitch

### Project Pitch
- Even though we did not have instructions as to what a project pitch is and how we should proceed, we remembered that the professor explained that we need to read a ShapeUp Piece about the project pitch.
- We spent a lot of time on Ingredient 1 which was the title the "Problem" in the shapeUp piece.
- Our Brainstorm clearly identified the main issue and the particular group that we were targetting with our project
- Targetted audience: Students learning remotely/online
- Problem: Students unable to be organized with their work due to many different softwares that organizes their work/too much assignment work from each class. There is no way for students to organize their work, and life
- Homework: Finish reading the shapeup article individually so that we can meet tomorrow and have a more in depth meeting about the project pitch and what we need to do.

### Slack Channel and Discussions and Labs
- Discussion Sections on Mondays via Google Meet with our TA in a private slack channel
- Frank added all of our team members to that private slack channel in the case that anyone wants to attend the discussion section on Mondays
- Frank gave a brief overview of what was talked about in the previous discussion session
- Asked if anyone wants to do labs together now that group members can do labs in groups of two.


## Current Timeline and thoughts for the week
We have finished our Brainstorm activity and we discussed more about our plans for the week.
- We plan to have 1-2 meetings during this week to work more on the project pitch and after we have been given more instruction about the project pitch.
- Submit all appropriate documents to canvas
- Attend the discussion section tomorrow if anyone wants
- READ THE SHAPEUP PIECE ABOUT THE PROJECT PITCH BEFORE TOMORROW'S MEETING AT 6 PM
- Someone needs to create another when2meet so that we all know if there is a time where we can meet during the week in addition to Sundays

Finished meeting on April 25th at 7 PM.
