# Notes from the Third Sprint Meeting
Date: Monday, June 7nd, 2021.      
Members Present: Everyone    
Time Started: 3 PM.   

## Agenda
1. Separate into two groups
2. One group tackles Journals Page
3. Second group works on Journal Entries Page

### Sprint from Journal’s Team
- Adjusted style of journal’s page and made sure that reduced width or height does not impact the rest of our site
- The pop up for the add journals was done although the team was working on a few fixes such as the style of the tags when they input a set number of tags. In addition, there we’re styling issues where the words would go off of the page
- In addition, on load, the site needed to acquire the journals and its relevant info from the database

### Sprint from Entries Team
- On this day, we were trying to create a journal specific entries page as talked about in yesterday’s meeting. 
- Thus, we were taking our existing code from a working all entries page and and converting it to show only one journal’s entries.
- So, we had to create a new add task screen and create new tags which we used the edit screen and the journal team’s tags popup to solve.
- In addition, we had to handle the color of the journal
- We also decided to implement nested lists when inputting descriptions
- Deleting tasks when pressing edit is complete
Plans for this week
 - Hold another sprint review meeting tomorrow (June 8th)
 - Continue doing more work with group members/individually
 - Start filming/recording and start on boarding soon

Finish Time: 8 PM.
