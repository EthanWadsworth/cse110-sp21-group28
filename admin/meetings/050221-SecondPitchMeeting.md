## Meeting Notes
- Wait for a couple of minutes to ensure that everyone joins before we get started with the meeting.
- Ethan and Frank explained that today, we will use Miro to create User Personas and we will also use a similar software for the wireframes

### Project Pitch
- Read through the canvas assignment for the project pitch and decided to create a google document to store our ideas

###### Personas
- Created two personas (Anne Oce and John Lot). 
  - John: He is a 21 year old studying how to be a veterinarian and he is known to be a procrastinator. He is not tech savvy, very lazy and is not organized.
    ** He is interested in football, animals, fashion.
    ** Juggles trying to find order in his life because of the fact that he has too much work and too many classes to deal with.
  - Anne: She is a 19 year old student who is an extrovert that is extremely outgoing, social, but her life is packed with the amount of work that she has so she needs to communicate her schedule for others. 
    ** Business Major at SDSU and has many friends with whom she needs to communicate her schedule with.
    ** Even though she is organized, she would like an all-in-one solution that allows other people to view her schedule and also help her keep track of her own schedule.

###### WireFrames
- Created a wireframe design to show how we envision our design will look like
- We plan to have a login screen, a video tutorial pop-up for first time users, journal creation/choosing screen, block view, calendar
- Sign in Screen: Login and Sign up capabilities
  - Create a new account/Sign up screen will ask to input a username, email, and passwords for set up purpose
- Finding the Bullet Journal You wanna work on (3 of most recent journals on screen with an option to create more and a search bar to search for more of your journals)
- once chosen, we move on to another page that has daily and weekly todos.
  - Daily and Weekly todos are laid out side by side and they will have tags (customizability) and a checklist to show what is done and what is not
- Calendar either in a separate page or would need to scroll down under weekly and daily todos.
  - Should have usual ability to go through each day of the month and check your todos
- If need be, there will be an option to share journals with other people.

### Project name
- After considering names such as 'celots', 'ocelots', 'taskalots', 'etc.', we decided on Jocelots because the bullet journal is a way to "jot" information down and ocelot is our team brand/name.

### Contact TA for Project Pitch meeting
- We contacted the TA via the teamleads chat on slack

## Current Timeline and thoughts for the week
We had a very productive meeting and are trying to contact the TA for more information and for more details on the project pitch meeting with him.
- We plan to meet sometime this week with the TA and proceed from there
- Submit all the PDF of our project onto the github reop
- Attend the discussion section this to ask our TA any last minute questions
- CDC Pipeline and ADR meeting sometime this week.
- Make another when2meet in anticipation that this coming weekend is Mother's Day.
Finished meeting on Sunday, May 2nd at 7:10 PM.
