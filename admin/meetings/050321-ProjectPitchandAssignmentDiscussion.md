## Pre meeting activities
- At 4 PM today, we had a project pitch meeting with our TA. Paarth and a few group members discussed our project and what our plans are for the project.
- Frank, Jacob, and I (Abhishek), attended the meeting and were involved with explaining the details about our project.

## Meeting Notes
- Wait for a couple of minutes to ensure that everyone joins before we get started with the meeting.
- Discuss our agenda

### Discuss Starting Pitch and TA's comments
- Go through the positives and negatives for the project pitch ideas
- Positive: 
    - Use case was really good and it was a very specific idea that is very much doable
- Negatives: 
    - Keep it as a journal and not as a calendar (calendar should be an optional feature)
    - Know what exactly we want to do for the journal and how the user should be able to input information into the bullet journal
    - Update our ideas of a database
    - Make it more interactive by drawing lines through tasks if a checkbox is checked
- We came into consensus about three ideas
    - 1. We should not worry about having a calendar unless we have time
    - 2. We should consider how our site looks like when a user wants to input information by clicking on one of the todos
    - 3. We need to have a basic understanding about a database before we start coding on the site.
- We updated the project pitch and created a new marker sketch in the rabbit holes section after going through what our TA informed us.

### First ADR markdown file (Journal Format)
- Searched online for a markdown template for the ADR 
- Chose to focus on individual classes and journal entries (more specific towards use cases)
- Focus more on the bullet journal and daily and weekly todos instead of the calendar because the calendar deters from our goal of a bullet journal.
- Decided to make an ADR every week so that all important decisions are well-documented.


### CI/CD Pipeline Phase 1
- Read through the CI/CD Pipeline as shown on canvas
- Addressed style management between all 8 of us.
- Use Airbnb Javascript linter to check/adopt this kind of style.
- Need more clarification from Prof and TA regarding this step/assignment.

### Team Sprint Review Meetings
- I (Abhishek Vasudevan) was tasked with doing the sprint review notes where we give updates on each assignment.
- We believe that we can go over this material again maybe towards the end of the week/ right before we have our first Sprint Review Meeting.


## Current Timeline and thoughts for the week
We had a very productive meeting and want more clarification form the TA/Prof about the CI/CD Pipeline.
- We plan to meet maybe twice more this week
- Attend the discussion section this to ask our TA any last minute questions
- CI/CD Pipeline and ADR meeting sometime this week.
Finished meeting on Monday, May 3rd at 6:50 PM.
