Today, our goal was to discuss the Project Pitch and 

## Agenda
1. Introduction -> explanation of what we will do today
2. Read the ShapeUp piece about project pitches
3. Go over the assignment located on canvas
4. Make a google doc and briefly go through each ingredient of the project pitch
5. Give a brief overview of the week and when we will work together again

## Meeting Notes
- Wait for a couple of minutes to ensure that everyone joins before we get started with the meeting.
- Ethan and Frank explained that today, we will go through more of the project pitch and create a google doc with our thoughts about the project pitch.
- First, we quickly read, analyzed, and summarized the shape up piece in detail because it was our homework

### Project Pitch
- Read through the canvas assignment for the project pitch and decided to create a google document to store our ideas
- Going more in detail about the project problem and identifying who's our audience
  - Our targetted audience is students during zoom university and our problem is that students' work are separated between numerous platforms and they need a better way to organize their work.
- Embedded sketches: Creating weekly todos/daily todos, reminders, classes(zoom and assignments), week overview, due dates
- Solution: Minimalistic Approach for a bullet journal such that students can easily organize tasks whether that be monthly/daily/weekly tasks. Our main concern is ensuring that the bullet journal is easy to use and user friendly.
  - Included daily tasks and todos for the student to remember to do to ensure that student is aware of his/her timelines.
  - Should be fairly customizable to allow for student comfortability
  - Different fonts/colors/texts/font-size/etc
  - Headers/custom tags/reminders to allow for customizability for the student's needs
  - Potential implementation of Calendar/Weekly Schedule if we have enough time during the next 5-6 weeks of implementation
- Appetite: 5-6 weeks and it depends a lot on the amount of time that all members of the group dedicate for this project given how busy each group member's lives are.
- User case: A student wants help on homework but student can't remember where professor has kept the list of TA/Prof office hours.
- Rabbit Holes: Database of specific tasks/entries with tags for each user.
  - Example: User -> Tags -> tagID
  - the tasks can have attributes such as the name, summary/description, ID and tags
- No-Gos: No templates will be provided so user has to create their own
   - designed for desktop use
   - user will be focused on UCSD students and difficulties of having numerous sites for each student
   - Users can't put images on blocks nor can they customize color of to-do blocks. (keep minimal)


## Current Timeline and thoughts for the week
We had a very productive meeting and plan to meet again later in the week to finish up our document for the project pitch
- We plan to have 1-2 meetings during this week to work more on the project pitch
- Submit all appropriate documents to canvas
- Attend the discussion section on Wednesday to ask our TA any questions
- Someone needs to create another when2meet so that we all know if there is a time where we can meet during the week in addition to Sundays

Finished meeting on April 26th at 7:10 PM.
