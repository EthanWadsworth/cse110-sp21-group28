## Brand:
Team colors - ocelot colors (yellow and brown to represent the ocelot, and green to represent the environment which the ocelot lives). Can't forget the color red to represent our spiciness.
Our mascot is Sam, the Spicy Minecraft Ocelot (picture attatched).
In regards to custom fonts, although we are spicy, we are also classy and refined, and as such we stick primarily to fonts such as Serif fonts.
Powerpoint themes will be primirily the colors black and yellow to keep in touch with our key branding.

## Team Name:
Spicy Ocelots
## Values:
Above all else, be spicy. But a mild spicy because anything too spicy is not enjoyable. Protect all ocelots and each other which means no toxicity within the group. We are a collective of spicy individuals.
