2: Primary Means of Communication and Expectations

State your team’s agreed upon various means of communication and expectations for response. \
- Main Communication: Slack
- We expect everyone to be responsive (within 24 hours) to messages or announcements on the above platform(s)

3: Scheduling Meetings (Schedule at least one meeting as part of constructing your team agreement.)


Agreed upon means of scheduling meetings. (Example: Team will agree, at the end of each class, to set any meetings times and agenda needed before the next class and beyond if possible. Team members will take turns to send out a reminder of the meeting with an agenda within eight hours after the class.) \
- We will use when2meet to determine the best time for everyone when scheduling group meetings
    - Weekly Meetings: Sundays @6PM on Zoom
    - Refer to When2Meet to schedule more meetings


4: General Responsibilities for All Team Members

This element of the team working agreement is the list of rules/agreements or the contract that all members agree to live by.

- Responding to emails/Slack within a certain time frame (24 hours or so)
- Document all code, research, etc, in a way that other team members can understand and pick up where you left off. 
- Have a record of all meetings in some capacity (this includes meetings outside of weekly general meetings, if possible). This will help other members stay in the loop.
- Be responsible for tasks that have been assigned to them. 
- Be responsive to communication within the group in order to ensure clarity regarding project deadlines and assignments. 
- Be honest with what you’ve done and what you haven't done so that the group knows what is going on at all times. 
- Be understanding of other time commitments outside of CSE110. 

5: Specific Team Member Responsibilities/Deadlines (Optional)

This section may be used to record specific tasks or responsibilities particular team members have assumed.

6: Conflict Resolution

Each team should have an agreed-upon approach to addressing issues that may arise. For example, if a team member is not meeting deadlines, the team agrees to do X [specific action decided by the team] to address the problem before bringing the issue to a TA or professor.

- If someone notices that a team member is not meeting deadlines or has not made noticeable progress on requested deliverables, the team leads should first be notified and the individual(s) messaged via Slack. If there is not a response in 24 - 48 hours (might have to adjust for weekends, but I still personally think this is reasonable) or little to no progress has still been made, a meeting with the team to discuss the issue should be scheduled. If in this meeting it is decided that a TA or professor should be contacted, then they should be contacted as soon as possible. Time should also be made to discuss which team members should take over the work supposed to be done by the inactive individual as a fallback. 
- If a team member decides to drop the class, they should notify the entire team including the TA as early as possible so that the rest of the team is prepared for their potential exit. If the team member leaving has made contributions to the development of the project, a meeting should be held with the rest of the team where the leaving member goes over what they have done, what needs to be done, any issues/bugs that need to be fixed, and all links and references that they have written or utilized up to that point.

7: Expectations of Faculty and GTA’s

Failure to abide by the written agreement will first result in a team meeting regarding the specific violations. If further infractions occur, faculty will be notified and consulted upon to solve the issue.
