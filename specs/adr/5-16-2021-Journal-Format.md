Technical Story: [We were trying to develop a MongoDB database for our application, however we encountered an issue in trying to set up the database and implement it with our technologies]

## Context and Problem Statement

[We wanted a NoSQL type database in order to facilitate the storing of records. Additionally, we found out that the setting up of MongoDB particularly troublesome
compared to Google Firebase's realtime database. We also found that if we used Google Firebase, we could also implement additional features from the service,
such as that of authentication which we could implement into our application and simplify this build process for us as well.]

## Decision Drivers 

* [Complexity of MongoDB setup]
* [Simplicity of Firebase]
* [Ability to use Firebase authentication as well as Firebase database and hosting]

## Considered Options

* [Using a SQL database]
* [Using a MongoDB database]
* [Using Google Firebase]
* 
## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[Using Google Firebase]", because [it would greatly improve the efficiently of our build process and provided us with a lot of tools needed to complete our project in an easy to implement fashion].
