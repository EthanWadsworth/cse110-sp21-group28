# [Chose to Focus on Individual Classes as Journal Topics]

* Status: [accepted] 
* Deciders: [Spicy Ocelots] 
* Date: [2021-05-03] 

Technical Story: [Our TA advised us to focus more on the journal side of things as opposed to the calendar.]

## Context and Problem Statement

[Our journals should be classes, which can be clicked on to show more information.
Some of our focus in our planning stage was a calendar, but the TA told us that doing so would distract us from the actual bullet journal.]

## Decision Drivers 

* [Time constrictions]
* [Loss of focus from the main goal/product]

## Considered Options

* [Keeping the calendar]
* [Not keeping the calendar]

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[Not keeping the calendar]", because [focusing too much on the calendar would take too much time and resources from the bullet journal].
